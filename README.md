# WhisperedHeart
Introducing "WhisperedHeart" - an innovative web application that empowers users to share their deepest confessions anonymously. With WhisperedHeart, users are required to register before accessing the platform, ensuring a secure and trusted environment for their confessional needs. Leveraging the power of OAuth 2.0, this website enables users to conveniently log in using their Google accounts, adding an extra layer of protection and peace of mind.

Once registered, users can unleash their thoughts and emotions by crafting and submitting their confessions within the platform. By maintaining anonymity, WhisperedHeart creates a safe space for individuals to express themselves freely without fear of judgment or repercussions.
